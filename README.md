# Lab8CA

This program is the combination of all the other labs we have done in the semester. It takes in a clock and reset bit, along with the flags for the various muxes and reads through the ROM and performs the instructions correctly. When combined with the control unit in the next lab, the program will become a full processor. The main module is the Lab8CA file which instantiates the various wires and inputs required for the datapath.
